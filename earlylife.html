        <p>As the son of the world’s greatest superhero, Mark always dreamed of developing powers of his own. However, for most of his childhood, he remained powerless, living an ordinary life as a high school student.</p>

        <p>Everything changed when, during his teenage years, Mark's powers finally manifested. He discovered that he had super strength, flight, and incredible durability, setting him on a path to become the hero known as Invincible.</p>
        
        <h2>Struggles of a Teen Hero</h2>
        <p>Balancing high school life with newfound responsibilities was no easy task. Mark had to juggle schoolwork, friendships, and his budding romance while training under his father’s guidance. His mother, Deborah, was a grounding presence, offering wisdom and emotional support.</p>
        
        <h2>Training and First Missions</h2>
        <p>Under Omni-Man’s mentorship, Mark learned how to control his abilities and push his limits. His first missions were clumsy but full of determination. He faced street-level criminals and minor threats before stepping up to battle greater dangers.</p>

        <h2>The Burden of a Legacy</h2>
        <p>As he grew into his powers, Mark began to understand the weight of his father’s legacy. He idolized Omni-Man, believing him to be the world’s greatest protector. However, as he continued his heroic journey, he began to uncover secrets that would shake his entire worldview.</p>
